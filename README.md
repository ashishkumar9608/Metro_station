# Bangalore Metro Shortest Path Finder

[Bangalore Metro]

Welcome to the **Bangalore Metro Shortest Path Finder** project! This web application is designed to help commuters in Bangalore find the shortest path between two points on the Bangalore Metro system. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project employs Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate both the shortest path and the fare for your journey.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our intuitive interface makes it easy for users to input their starting and ending stations.

- **Shortest Path Calculation:** The application uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between the selected stations, ensuring that you reach your destination with minimum stops.

- **Fare Calculation:** In addition to the shortest path, our tool also calculates the fare for your journey based on the number of stations and distance traveled.

- **Interactive Metro Map:** Explore the Bangalore Metro system using our interactive map to view station locations and plan your routes.
